# Pitch Tester

Pitch Tester is a web app for training your ear to recognize and match musical pitches. Built with Next.js, it lets you test your ability to match a randomly played frequency using interactive audio controls.

## Features

- **Pitch Matching Game:**
  - Click "Start New Game" to hear a random target tone (200â€“1000 Hz).
  - The target tone plays for 3 seconds, then pauses for 1 second.
  - After the pause, use the plus and minus buttons to adjust your guess frequency.
  - You can set the frequency step size for fine or coarse adjustments.
  - The app plays your guess tone continuously as you adjust it.
  - Submit your guess to see how close you were to the original pitch.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes with a button in the top right corner.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile.
